Hey, these are [@travisjeffery's](http://twitter.com/travisjeffery) dotfiles.

In terms of Zsh and Vim setups they're about as advanced as they get, check out the [.zshrc](https://github.com/travisjeffery/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc) and
[.vimrc](https://github.com/travisjeffery/dotfiles/blob/master/.vim/vimrc) for
the details.

To get started:

``` sh
git clone git://github.com/travisjeffery/dotfiles.git && 
cd dotfiles && 
git submodule update --init --recursive && 
./bin/hlink
```

And you should be good to go.
