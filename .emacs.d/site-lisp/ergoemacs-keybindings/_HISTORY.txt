# when viewing this file in emacs, press Shift+Tab 3 times to expand all headings.

Note: When talking about key POSITION on keyboard, QWERTY is used, unless otherwise specified. For example, “Changed Alt+y to something”, that “y” means the key that is under the key 7. (which is Dvorak's “f”). But when talking about code, such as “remap M-r to something”, that means the letter r on whatever layout.

** 2011-04-17 r647
ergoemacs-mode.el 5.3.9.
Fixed a bug
http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/issues/detail?id=91
with a default GNU Emacs, when cua-mode is NOT turned on, load ergoemacs-mode and turn it on, then keys with Shift will also highlight text. This is because ergoemacs-fix-cua--pre-command-handler-1 tries to set symbols from cua-mode but they are not there.

fixed by temp turning on cua-mode.

** 2011-03-22 r638
http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/source/detail?r=638
ergoemacs-mode.el 5.3.8. Added a ergoemacs-auto-complete-mode-hook.

** 2010-11-18 r556
added a hotkey 【Ctrl+Shift+t】 for open-last-closed in ErgoEmacs keybinding package. This key follows browser convention. But won't work in Terminal...

** 2010-12-10 r578. 
modified ErgoEmacs keybinding so that copy/cut with no text selection will include the line ending. Thanks to Max Arnold.

* version 5.3.7, 2010-11-15

** Added open-in-desktop command with key 【Ctrl+Shift+O】.

** Added open-last-closed command.

** More international layouts

Added Danish layout. Thanks to Michael Budde
Added ergoemacs-layout-pt-nativo.el. Thanks to Xavier Pinho

You can see all supported layouts and their contributors in the directory 〔ergoemacs-keybindings〕.

** minor fixes

*** 【Ctrl+Backspace】 for backward-kill-word

This is a standard key together with 【Ctrl+Arrow】 and 【Ctrl+Del】.

r477 Technically, removed the unbinding of <C-backspace>.

*** Added ergoemacs-keyboard-quit-key to ergoemacs-layout-gb.el

A bug fix. Thanks to Jorge Dias.

* version 5.3.4, 2010-08-16

** Added a Swedish layout
Contributed by Kristian Hellquist.

** remapped split window keys for all layouts.

OLD             command                  new
Alt+1        delete-other-windows        Alt+3
Alt+!        delete-window               Alt+0
Alt+2        split-window-vertically     Alt+4
Alt+@         split-window-horizontally   Alt+$

Reason: the 1 and 2 keys are two of the most difficult to press keys on the top row.
3 and 4 are the best for left hand.
8 and 9 are the best for right hand.
(this can be verified by looking at the original Dvorak layout for number keys)

For emacs commands, according to command frequency statistics, the order are roughly this, from most used to least:

delete-other-windows
split-window-vertically
delete-window
split-window-horizontally

therefore this change. For Xah Lee's personal experience in this, see:
 http://xahlee.org/emacs/vi_esc_syndrome.html

Note that Alt+0 for delete-window was in the original ErgoEmacs keybinding design for about a year, but got changed to Alt+Shift+1 (Alt+!). The thinking was for some logical consistency with Alt+1. My experience since is that logical consistency is bad for ergonomics advantage. Logical consistency is good at beginning for learning, but once muscle memory is developed, ergonomic efficiency is far more important, and will be used for years.

* version 5.3.3, 2010-05-24

** Ctrl+p now asks for confirmation before printing
Ctrl+p will now ask user confirmation before printing the current buffer.
This is to prevent unintentional printing.
Old Emacs users tends to press Ctrl+p a lot because that used to be moving cursor up.
See: http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/issues/detail?id=60

* version 5.3.2, 2010-05-22

** Added United Kingdom layout (gb).

http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/issues/detail?id=67#c3

** Copy and Cut to copy/cut current line

Added a feature so that copy/cut will get the current line if there's no text selection.

* version 5.x.x
Italian layout has been created, by By David Capello, with help by Francesco Biccari

A colemak layout is added or sometimes before. The bulk of key mapping was helped by Ivan Haralamov (aka postivan), and vockets?

* version 5, 2009-09-15

** Changed into a minor mode, with support for many keyboard layouts

By David Capello.
This version is now a full featured minor mode. It supports 3 different keyboard layout: US QWERTY, US Dvorak, and “Spanish (Spain)” (aka “Spanish (International sort)”). Also supports a new command where-is-old-binding (with shortcut Ctrl+h o).

* version 4.3.13, 2009-08-28

* version 4.3.12.1, 2009-08-14

** A minor implementation improvement. In one place, changed the use of functionp to fboundp for checking the existing of a emacs 23 feature recenter-top-bottom. Was using functionp because i forgot about fboundp.

* version 4.3.12, 2009-08-13

** Alt+p is now “recenter-top-bottom” for emacs 23 users. In emacs 22, it is “recenter”.

* version 4.3.11, 2009-08-05

** Added a hook to fix message-mode.

* version 4.3.10, 2009-06-14

** fixed a previous/next reversal for f11/f12 keys in rcirc-mode-hook.

* version 4.3.9, 2009-06-14

** unbind C-x 3 (use Alt+@ for split-window-horizontally)
** unbind C-M-% (use Alt+% for query-replace-regexp). 
** unbind C-@ (use Alt+SPACE for set-mark-command). 
** unbind M-{ (use Alt+U for backward-paragraph). 
** unbind M-} (use Alt+O for forward-paragraph). Thanks to marciomazza

* version 4.3.8, 2009-06-14

** added 【】 to select-text-in-quote.

* version 4.3.7, 2009-05-27

** ibuffer's M-s changed in emacs 23, such that M-s is now a prefix. For Dvorak users, M-s should be isearch. This is reclaimed to be isearch. For qwerty users, M-s should be other-window. Fixed.

* version 4.3.6, 2009-05-26

** dired's M-s changed in emacs 23, such that M-s is now a prefix. For Dvorak users, M-s should be isearch. This is reclaimed to be isearch. For qwerty users, M-s should be other-windox. Fixed.

* version 4.3.5, 2009-05-10

** experimental modification to shrink-whitespaces.

* version 4.3.4, 2009-04-19

** Added Ctrl+Shift+n for opening a new window (make-frame-command). Removed “C-x 5 2”. Added Ctrl+Shift+w for closing window (delete-frame), removed “C-x 5 0”.

* version 4.3.2, 2009-03-11

** Removed C-x o for other-window. (use Alt+s and Alt+Shift+s instead.)

* version 4.3.1, 2009-03-04

** A better implementation for making M-t call M-TAB. So that, describe-key on M-t will show better documentation.

* version 4.3.0, 2009-03-02

** Added Alt+Shift+x for cut-all and Alt+Shift+c for copy-all.

* version 4.2.4, 2009-03-01

** fixed a dired binding so that Ctrl+o runs find-file instead of dired-display-file

* version 4.2.2, 2009-03-01

** Removed the default keybinding for split-window-vertically (Ctrl+x 2). Use Alt+2 instead.
** The key “Ctrl+x Ctrl+b” is now ibuffer, instead of list-buffers.
** “Ctrl+h m” now calls describe-major-mode.

* version 4.2.1, 2009-02-28

Changed the keybinding for previous-user-buffer from Ctrl+← to Ctrl+PageUp. And previous-emacs-buffer from Ctrl+Shift+← to Ctrl+Shift+PageUp. Similar for the “next” versions. Rationale: The Ctrl+Arrow are standard editing shortcuts commond in Windows, Mac, Linux.

* version 4.2.0, 2009-02-27

It now works non-english letters such as éÉ and single letter word “a teapot” or words starting with a number “1st timer”. Thanks to Andreas Politz and Nikolaj Schumacher.

** Removed unfill-paragraph and unfill-region
Because they are defined in ourcomments-util.el bundled with emacs 22, also because they are not used in this file now (compact-uncompact-block replaced most of their functionality).

* version 4.1, 2008-10-06

** Added keys for about 9 commands
 previous-user-buffer, next-user-buffer, next-frame-command, previous-frame-command, query-replace and query-replace-regexp, move-cursor-to-next-pane, move-cursor-to-previous-pane, split-window-horizontally, toggle-letter-case. Combined delete-blank-lines and just-one-space to shrink-whitespaces.
