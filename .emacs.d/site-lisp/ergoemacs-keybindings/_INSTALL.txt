* INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

** 1. Unzip the folder.
If you downloaded a file named “ergoemacs-keybindings-5.3.9.zip”, unzip it.

On Windows, you can right click the file name and choose “Extract All...”.

On Mac OS X, you can double click to unzip.

On Linux (and Mac OS X), you can type “unzip ergoemacs-keybindings-5.3.9.zip” on a command console.

Now you should have a folder named “ergoemacs-keybindings-5.3.9”.

** 2. Place the folder in your emacs load path.

For examples:

On Windows:
%HOMEPATH%\.emacs.d\ergoemacs-keybindings-5.3.9

On Mac OS X or Linux:
~/.emacs.d/ergoemacs-keybindings-5.3.9

If the folder “.emacs.d” doesn't exist, you can go ahead and create it.

** 3. Specify your keyboard layout.

Place ONE of the following line in your emacs init file (~/.emacs):

(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "us") ; US

(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "dv") ; US Dvorak (Ergonomic)

(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "gb") ; UK

(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "gb-dv") ; UK Dvorak

(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "sp") ; Spanish (Spain) (aka “Spanish (International sort)”)

(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "it") ; Italian

(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "sv") ; Swedish

(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "da") ; Danish

(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "pt-nativo") ; (Ergonomic) PT-Nativo from http://tecladobrasileiro.com.br

(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "colemak") ; (Ergonomic) Colemak http://colemak.com/

** 4. Make Emacs load the file, and turn on the mode.

Place the following lines in your emacs init file.

;; load ErgoEmacs keybinding
(load "~/.emacs.d/ergoemacs-keybindings-5.3.9/ergoemacs-mode")

;; turn on minor mode ergoemacs-mode
(ergoemacs-mode 1)

These lines should be placed below your keyboard layout in step 3.

Make sure that the path points to your file is correct.

You do not need to have the file path end in “.el”.

** 5. Restart emacs.

After you restart emacs, you will be using the new keybinding. The keyboard shortcut for emacs's “M-x” (execute-extended-command) is now “Alt+a”.

To turn off the mode, type “Alt+a” then “ergoemacs-mode”. After that, your keybinding is the same as GNU Emacs's default keybinding.

The command “ergoemacs-mode” toggles the minor mode.

* Byte Compile Elisp Files (Optional)

If you like, you can byte-compile the elisp files. To byte compile them, call the command “byte-compile-file”, then the elisp file name. Once you do that, emacs will create a file with “.elc” ending, and will automatically load byte compiled file if there is one.

You can byte compile the whole directory. To do so, run the following in command line console. Here's a bash example on OS X's Terminal:

emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile ~/.emacs.d/ergoemacs-keybindings-5.3.9/*.el

Byte compiled files makes loading and running programs about 5 or more times faster, but for small elisp files, the speed increase is probably not noticeable.

You do not need to change any lines in the emacs initialization given above.
