;;; Comment:
;; This is still WIP.
;;
;; This was written from scratch, without using Vivek Sharma's code:
;; it had issues I wanted to correct, but unfortunately there were no
;; licence indication, and Vivek didn't answered my mails.
;;
;; This is still pretty basic: there is indentation, syntax
;; hilighting, speedbar/imenu support. The indentation is pretty naïve
;; but robust, and sufficient for my current needs.
