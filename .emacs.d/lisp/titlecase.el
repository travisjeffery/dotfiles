;;; Version: 1.1
;;; Author: Jason R. Blevins <jrblevin@sdf.org>
;;; Keywords: title case, capitalization, writing.

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; Currently, this is simply a wrapper for the `titlecase` Perl script
;; written by John Gruber and Aristotle Pagaltzis.  This script can be
;; found at <https://github.com/ap/titlecase>.  If `titlecase` is not
;; in your path, you must change the value of `titlecase-command'
;; accordingly.

;;; Code:

(defvar titlecase-command "titlecase")

(defconst titlecase-buffer "*titlecase output*")

(defun titlecase-string (str)
  "Convert string STR to title case and return the resulting string."
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert str)
    (call-process-region (point-min) (point-max) titlecase-command t t nil)
    ;; Skip trailing newline omitted by titlecase
    (buffer-substring (point-min) (point-max))))

(defun titlecase-region (begin end)
  "Convert text in region from BEGIN to END to title case."
  (interactive "*r")
  (let ((pt (point)))
    (insert (titlecase-string (delete-and-extract-region begin end)))
    (goto-char pt)))

(defun titlecase-dwim ()
  "Convert the region or current line to title case.
If Transient Mark Mode is on and there is an active region, convert
the region to title case.  Otherwise, work on the current line."
  (interactive)
  (if (and transient-mark-mode mark-active)
      (titlecase-region (region-beginning) (region-end))
    (titlecase-region (point-at-bol) (point-at-eol))))
